# swirlify 0.2.1

* Add `swirl2html()` to convert swirl lessons formatted in YAML to R markdown (Rmd) and html files. The output is a stylized webpage that acts as a standalone tutorial based on the original swirl lesson.

# swirlify 0.2

* Add a more bare bones YAML authoring toolset initiated by `new_yaml()`. `hlp()` gives a list of related functions. We plan to integrate this new approach more closely with existing swirlify functions, but it functions well as is.
